Notes
------
1) Review the issue: 
	[Avinash] caGrid.org was started by OSU Development team before CBIIT had a wiki infrastructure. Now that caGrid KC is established, does it make sense (resources, consistency) for caBIG(r) to support two wikis? 
	[Scott] Objectively we don't need two sites, but we do because they currently fulfill two roles (which could be merged). As middleware, non-cancer adopters we target (CTSA, etc) are hesitant to use cancer-branded software. Also, concern that caGrid.org is hosted at OSU, may need to address longevity of artifacts and service level agreements. 
	[Steve] Put yourself in the shoes of another program, there is some natural competition, and using caBIG(r) branded software doesn't make that PI look good. 
	[Joel] Acceptance of caGrid is better than expected, a large part of semantics is coming though unfunded efforts. Inclined to tweak around the edges but in general it's going fine.
	[Justin] Different strengths for caGrid.org and caGrid KC Wiki. 
	[John] Understands why we have two right now, but if the KC tech stack were different it would be ideal to have just one site. 
	[Mike] Programmatically, one point of entry, one landing page. 
2) Question: [Avinash] Given two wikis, looking one year out, what problems do you see?
	[Scott] It was a problem, but since dev and KC discussed prior to 1.3 release, it's pretty clear what content goes where. Each wiki is serving two different purposes. 
	[Steve] Problem with relationship between NCI and Knowledge Center (since metrics are being kept).
	[Justin] CVRG, as an example, benefitted from having two wiki sites. 
	[John] Would be concerned if some policy changes requires content to be located in one place to another. 


Action Items
------------
1) [Steve, Justin, Scott, John] A document (1-2 pages) proposing what content goes on what wiki so Avinash can take this to the caBIG(r) leadership. 
2) Determine how to ensure availability and durability through an honest broker like caBIG(r)?
