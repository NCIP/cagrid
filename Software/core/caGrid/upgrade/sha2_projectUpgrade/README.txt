This directory contains scripts for upgrading projects that were created by
introduce from older versions of caGrid to the version that uses SHA-2.

The scripts assume that the directory structure originally created by introduce
is unchanged. They also assume that any .jar files added to the project are
compatible with the new version of caGrid.
