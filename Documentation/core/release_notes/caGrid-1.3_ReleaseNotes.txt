                      1.0 caGrid Introduction
================================================================

    This document contains the release notes for the caGrid 1.3
    release.  

    caGrid 1.3 is a point release of the caGrid 1.x stream.  It
    is generally backwards compatible with the service
    interfaces of caGrid 1.0/1.1/1.2. That is, services and
    applications developed against the caGrid 1.0 or 1.1 or 1.2
    release, will continue to function against caGrid 1.3
    versions of those services (including the production grid).
    More details on backwards compatibility can be found here:
    http://cagrid.org/display/caGrid13/Deprecation%20Plan

    This release of caGrid supports caBIG compatibility level gold.

The complete list of new features and additional details can be found on the project Gforge Tracker:
	http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/?atid=2252&group_id=25&func=browse
    
Specific highlighted improvements in caGrid 1.3 include:
* Continuous Integration:
  caGrid 1.3 enhances support for the latest releases (version 4.1.1) of the caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK)
  and Common Security Module (CSM). caGrid and the caCORE SDK now share a common code base for CQL.
  In addition, caGrid 1.3 supports the most recent web services containers in the
  NCI CBIIT Technology Stack (Tomcat 5.5 and JBoss 4.0.5).
* Data Services:
  Significant enhancements to the Federated Query Processor (FQP), allowing a single, semantic query to execute across
  multiple caGrid services and return a single result set. FQP now supports WS-Notification, querying secure grid services
  via the caGrid Credential Delegation Service (CDS), configurable query execution parameters to allow only partial results
  to be returned, and out-of-band results using the caGrid Transfer Service and WS-Enumeration.
* Introduce Toolkit
  The Introduce Toolkit has a number of security-related enhancements, adding fine-grain control over authorization using
  the caCORE Common Security Module (CSM) and Grid Grouper. Introduce also includes service updaters, allowing service
  developers to easily update-to and leverage caGrid 1.3.
* Metadata Services:
  The Mobius Global Model Exchange (GME) has been entirely rewritten for caGrid 1.3 to support the semantic
  requirements of caBIG¨ software developers. The caGrid-developed caDSR grid service, based on the caCORE 3.1 API,
  has been deprecated, It has been replaced by the caDSR 4.0 data service (maintained by the caDSR team), and a
  new caGrid Metadata Model Service (MMS), whose purpose is creation and semantic annotation of caGrid
  metadata models using caDSR-derived data.
* Security:
  Enhancements to the GAARDS infrastructure include support for multiple authentication profiles,
  including one-time passwords. Trusted Identity Providers can now be discovered programmatically, allowing full
  realization of federated authentication use cases. Auditing support has also been added to Dorian, giving systems
  administrators the degree of control they have requested.
* Workflow
  Orchestration of caGrid services is supported in this release though joint development with the Taverna project.
  The caGrid plug-in for the Taverna 2.0 workbench allows development of workflows using their rich user interface.
