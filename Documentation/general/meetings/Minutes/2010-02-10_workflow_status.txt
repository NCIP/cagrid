Agenda
------
1) caGrid 1.4 Status
2) NSF Proposal

Notes
-----
1) Discussed code freeze schedule with Scott. Would be happy if it slips a couple weeks but 

Taverna 2.1.1 being released "in a few days". APIs built under contract with us to support CDS have changed to support other use cases. Other changes in new year: using Java 1.6

CDS integration issue is basically done. 

Added a resource (Tom Howe) who is partially funded on the KC to meet the deliverable date. 

2) [Ravi] Question: does John have metrics/notes from the Index Service and move to Xindice? NSF service registration work that ANL is bidding on. Our notes from the Index Service would be helpful on that. 


Action Items
------------
1) Ravi will review project schedule and update. 
2) John will send notes from Index Service and ping Avinash about letter of recommendation.
