This project was developed as part of the NCI caBIG initiative.

In 2013, as part of the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) Open Development Initiative,
the cagrid source code was migrated to GitHub to allow further development by the broader
community. At that time, the caGrid project was forked into multiple sub-projects on github. We
recommend you checkout and use of those, not this repository.
