Agenda
------
1) Review requirements and use cases to-date
2) Discuss new requirements and use cases

Notes
-----
1a) Regeneration of GIDs: (JK) caBIO's bigID always issues new IDs, even if there is a typo (SO) Different communities in caBIG(r) will have different needs 
1b) (IF & SO) multiple ids on one object is ok, multiple objects for one id is NOT ok.
1c) (JK) No mention of Correlation or Co-identification (SO) If you use identifiers in your application, not a big deal. If you use central identifiers, more difficult.
1d) (JK) Identifiers should take two additional inputs: OIDs and IIs (ISO datatypes)
1e) (JK) It may be valid for us to produce a series of frameworks, not just one. (SO) generally agreed provided they were unique and resolvable across the grid. 

Action Items
------------
1) Scott and Calixto should enumerate the possible deployment scenarios for follow up meeting with larger group
2) Specimen Sample Use Case to John E. once finalized (Libby)
3) Review of use case to propose where the Identifiers Framework would fit, and what implementation or processes would be required of the adopting application (John E., Scott, Calixto once we receive #1)
