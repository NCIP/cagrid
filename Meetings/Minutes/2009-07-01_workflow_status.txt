-----
1) Still making API changes in Taverna Workbench. Beta 2 in June, official 2.1 should be August-end. Support to send the EPR to a delegated credential already built-into the Taverna Workflow Service. Changes to the Taverna Workflow Service: invocation of the Taverna Execution Engine uses default heap size, workflow build file downloading latest Taverna JARs from Maven
