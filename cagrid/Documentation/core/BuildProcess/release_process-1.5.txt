The SVN trunk will be where active development occurs, and we will create a branch to maintain the release.
Users/Developers wanting to checkout the "release" will use a provided tag.

The release will have a "release engineer" who is responsible for the steps below, and should review all commits
(and reject any in appropriate changes) to the release branch.  Any planned development on the branch should
first be ok'd by the release engineer.

In the current process (for 1.3+; not true in the past), only the "caGrid" module is being formally released.
However, all "release" tags and branches should be performed against the full repository.
For example, while the system/integration tests (tests module), are not released, they are run against a given release and so must be branched with the core release.  

RELEASE PROCESS
====================
----- prepare the release branch -----
send email to the development mailing list announcing a version control freeze
tag a branch root from the cagrid trunk (svn copy https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/trunk/cagrid/ https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_root)
create a branch based on the branch root tag  (svn copy https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_root https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/branches/caGrid-1_5_release/)

----- prepare the release candidate -----
get a working checkout of the release branch in a new directory (svn checkout --username {SVN_USERNAME} https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/branches/caGrid-1_5_release/)
do fixing or cleaning needed on the branch (setting versions (ant set-project-versions), set the version in README.txt, LICENSE.txt, default target grids (in caGrid/antfiles/target-grid.xml), set ivy publish status to "release" (in publish-artifacts macro of caGrid/antfiles/ivy/ivy-shared-targets.xml) etc)
cleanup / edit service metadata of core services to reflect the new version name 1.5 instead of 1.5-dev
setup automated builds/tests for the branch (copy existing hudson builds for continuous and system tests, change the SVN repository location it pulls from to the new branch)
check in all the changes made so far to the release branch
tag a release candidate of the branch (svn copy https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/branches/caGrid-1_5_release/ https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_rcX/)

-----  make a release candidate package -----
export the svn repository, preferably in a clean environment, like a snapshoted VM, to clean out .svn dirs (svn export https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_final/)
zip up, or whatever is needed for the release, the directory created {dir for checkout}, usually the Software/core/caGrid directory (zip -r caGrid-1.5.zip caGrid)
execute a build, upload the ivy artifacts from Software/core/caGrid/integration-repository to software.cagrid.org.  Create a new dir for them following the naming convention for 1.4 artifacts.  When the release is complete, change the symlink for "repository" from the 1.4 location to 1.5

----- address any issues with the candidate -----
*** if bug fixes
  create JIRA issues
  commit the fixes to our local branch checkout (svn commit, comment link to relevant JIRA / GForge issue)
  tag a bug fix tag off the branch (svn copy https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/branches/caGrid-1_5_release/ https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_4_release_rcX_bugfix-{JIRA-ISSUE-ID}/)
  merge bug fix into trunk as appropriate
  rinse and repeat... when satisfied that no bugs remain in the release candidate, tag a new release candidate (svn copy https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/branches/caGrid-1_5_release/ https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_rcX+1)

-----  finalize the release (after validation of last RC; this should just be retagging the last RC as the final)-----
tag the release on the branch (svn copy https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/branches/caGrid-1_5_release/ https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_final)
  --OR if a release was already made from an RC, move the last RC to be the final in SVN: (svn move https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_rcX https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_final)
create the release (see "make a release candidate package")

----- prepare the trunk for new development -----
fix items in the trunk (e.g. project versions, service metadata, extension version numbers) to indicate it is the next release (when next release is known)
  -- Typically this means changing the version to 1.N-dev to indicate it's a development version
 


INSTALLER RELEASE
====================
Create file release on gforge - make this a hidden release if you're just testing the process!

It's a good idea to build the release on a clean system, like a VM, and with the username "cagrid" so the generated jars show that username as the builder

----- get checkouts -----
mkdir <directory for release>
cd <directory for release>
svn export https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/tags/caGrid-1_5_release_final

----- create caGrid source release -----
cd Software/core
zip -r caGrid-1.5.zip caGrid
mv  caGrid-1.5.zip <directory for release>
md5sum <directory for release>/caGrid-1.5.zip > <directory for release>/caGrid-1.5.zip.md5

----- verify the build/test -----
cd caGrid
ant all test

----- upload caGrid release -----
Upload to GForge, <directory for release>/caGrid-1.5.zip
	Specify the release name as "caGrid-1.5"
Copy the URL to this release (caGrid-1.5.zip) from GForge's file release system for use in the installer below, refer to this as <CAGRID URL>
	!!!NOTE!!! If the URL starts with https://, change it to http:// or it WON'T WORK due to the .gov SSL certs not being trusted out-of-the-box by Java for downloading URLs
Copy the md5 value from caGrid-1.5.zip.md5, and refer to this as <CAGRID MD5>
Upload the .md5 file to GForge as well so others may reference it when downloading the source distribution

----- create installer properties file -----
Obtain a checkout of the installer properties section of the SVN repository
	svn co https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/branches/caGrid-1_5_release/Software/core/installer/properties/
Copy the cagrid.installer.properties file from <directory for release>/Software/core/caGrid/projects/installer/cagrid.installer.properties to the checkout of the properties directory and name it caGrid-1.5.installer.properties
	This will be referred to as <INSTALLER PROPERTIES FILE> 
Edit the <INSTALLER PROPERTIES FILE> file to reference the caGrid-1.5.zip uploaded to <CAGRID URL>
Uncomment edit the cagrid.md5.checksum to reference <CAGRID MD5>
Set the cagrid.version property as needed; 1.5 in this case
Commit this properties file to the SVN repository.  Refer to this as <PROPS URL> 
	For this release, this will be https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/cagrid/branches/caGrid-1_5_release/Software/core/installer/properties/cagrid-1.5.installer.properties

----- create installer release -----
cd <directory for release>/Software/core/caGrid/projects/installer
#NOTE: if you cannot provide these values yet, you can use placeholders, and then edit: <directory for release>/cagrid.installer.properties
#  the download.properties.url is the only property value that is actually built into the created installer zip
#  so it is strongly encouraged you know the value of that before hand (as to change it you must edit the value
#  in the download.properties file, inside the caGrid-installer-1.5.jar, inside the caGrid-1.5.zip)
#  For release candidates, you can run this command once to create the properties file, upload it to GForge (get the URL), then run it again passing the properties URL in
ant -Ddownload.properties.url=<PROPS URL> \
  -Dcagrid.download.url=<CAGRID URL> \
  clean dist-installer
mv build/caGrid-installer-1.5.zip <directory for release>

----- upload installer -----
Upload <directory for release>/caGrid-1.5-installer.zip to GForge

POST RELEASE
====================
----- test the installer -----
Download the installer zip from GForge, run it

----- community announcements -----
coordinate with project manager to make official release announcement on caGrid users and dev lists, KC forums, cagrid.org news, etc.
	Be sure to post links to the installer, release notes, and documentation pages on cagrid.org
