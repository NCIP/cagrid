Agenda
------
1) Known SDK touch points within caGrid (to orient Greg and Sree)
2) CQL2 Data Services support for SDK-generated systems using 4.3
3) Other caGrid touch points within SDK (e.g. consumption of grid credentials for authentication) 

Notes
-----
1) a) Use Grid jars to support consumption of Grid Credentials. b) CQL query interface. c) Remote API as input, Data Service as output d) Introduce uses SDK to generate beans
2) Grid team proposes the SDK deprecate CQL support within SDK, continue to bundle CQL1 jars during deprecation period, and CQL2 support only provided through a grid data service. SDK team proposes to bundle CQL2 support, which will not be trivial given implementation.
3) Some question about need for use case (support of Grid authentication within SDK). Bundled 1.3 JARs should continue to work with 1.4 security services (refer to Deprecation Plan). A future SDK release can include the caGrid 1.4 JARs.
