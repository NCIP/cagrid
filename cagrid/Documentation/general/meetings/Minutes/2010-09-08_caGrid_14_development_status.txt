Agenda
------
1) QA
2) Three of interest: 
   a) CSM 3.2/Authentication Service 
   b) Installer issue with Windows XP SP3 
   c) Grid Grouper

Notes
-----
1) Deployment of RC1 still in progress. Need 2 containers for Identifiers NA, HTTP500 from Identifiers Admin WebApp; Redeploy FQP 1.4 RC3 in QA. Just need to redeploy overtop with nightly installer (step 6), should not need to redeploy Transfer. 
2) a) wrote and delivered our own fix, not certain CSM team's fix resolves our issue. Trying to test and verify at OSUMC. 
   b) Edge case where install fails at 80% when deploying a container from Installer, commands-themselves work fine. May be Java related, may be Install code related. 
   c) Tested a fix: changed collation type of the column that containers grid ids to be case sensitive. 

Action Items
------------
1) John needs to update ARC and PTE for Systems Team [done]. 
   John will reach out to Aynur to update FQP service. 
   Need to additional test cases to Aynur that verify issues have been resolved:
   (New Test Cases: searching for users in Dorian forced a redeployment, test by launching 1.3 GAARDS UI. Grid Grouper test for case sensitivity). 
2) a) Need to verify this fix and sync up with CSM team
   b) Continuing to investigate.
   c) Joe will determine if this fix should be delivered by an ant target or just a script (likely latter), and send to John to propagate up tiers.
