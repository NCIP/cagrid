On behalf of the caGrid team, I am pleased to announce the release of caGrid Portal version 2.1. Enhancements in this release focus on presentation and diagnosis of discovered services, and support for community developed portlets.

     a user-friendly interface for scientific researchers that allows for easy and intuitive 
     browsing of data within the caBIO system.  For more information about caBIO, please see
