http://cagrid.org/display/dataservices/CQL+2 contains information on CQL 2, use cases, and the tech preview release.

We're using castor for serializing CQL 2 and DCQL 2 since Axis can't properly handle some "complicated" <xsd:choice> cases and attributes from custom-serialized data types in Axis serialized elements.
The castor source dir exists because all castor mapping files have to live in the same Jar for the castor mapping loader to find them at runtime via <include> in the mapping file (See DCQL 2's mapping file)
