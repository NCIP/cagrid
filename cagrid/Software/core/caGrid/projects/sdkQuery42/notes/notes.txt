Dave,

I have created a new tag for cagrid team to test the SDK 4.2. http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/svnroot/cacoresdk/tags/CACORESDK_42_caGRID1302

You can check it out and then execute following steps to get SDK running

1	go to sdk-toolkit\example-project\build
2	Modify codegen.properties and install.properties
3	If you want to SDK to setup the database then “comment” the exclude.database property
4	Set the DB_* properties for your database
5	Copy cagrid ivy repository in sdk-toolkit\software\local-ivy-repo directory
	* create the local-ivy-repo directory
	* cp the caGrid\integration-repository\caGrid\* dirs as a subdirs of local-ivy-repo
	** maybe it's \bda-local-ivy-repo???? - nope
	*** Satish provided a new ivysettings.xml that goes in software\common and pulls from the 1.3 latest integration published by Hudson.  Using that, and throwing out my local-ivy-repo dir seems to build OK
6	Execute and deploy:local:install command
	* In the sdk-toolkit\example-project\build dir
	* This builds everything and tries to set up a tomcat container for you.  Can I just get a build???
	** Yes: deploy:local:install:re-configure
7	Output goes to sdk-toolkit\example-project\target\dist\exploded\output\example\package\directory


Let me know if you have any question

Thanks,
Satish
