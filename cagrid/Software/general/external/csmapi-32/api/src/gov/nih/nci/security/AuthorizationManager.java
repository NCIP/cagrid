/**
 * 
 * The <code>AuthorizationManager</code> interface provides all the
 * authorization methods and services offered by the Common Security Module.
 * This interface defines the contract that any class which wants to acts as an
 * authorization manager should follow to be able to fit in the Common Security
 * Framework. It defines the methods which are required for the purpose of
 * authorizing a user against the configured authorization data. This
 * interface by default is implemented by the
 * {@link UserProvisioningManager}. If the client application wants to use its own
 * Authorization Class, then it should implement the
 * <code>AuthorizationManager</code> interface. Also an entry should be configured
 * in the <code>ApplicationServiceConfig</code> file against the Application
 * Context Name regsitering the class, which it wants to use, as shown below
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  	&lt;application&gt;
 *	   		&lt;context-name&gt;
 *	   			FooApplication
 *	      	&lt;/context-name&gt;

 *			&lt;/authorization&gt;
 *		&lt;/application&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * 
 * If the client application wants to use just the authorization service then it can
 * obtain the implementation of the <code>AuthorizationManager</code> interface from the 
 * {@link SecurityServiceProvider} class.
