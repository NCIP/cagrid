Notes
-----
1) Steve received signed memorandum between NIH and InCommon this week
Scott proposes:
  a) Have Santhosh document what current implementation doesn't support
  b) Document possibly alternative architectures
  c) Estimate impact/LOE

CTSA has use cases to integrate with non-Java providers
Santhosh has done LOE for moving to Shib
[Scott] what's LOE to modify our current implementation to support InCommon?

Requirements: 
  [Scott] how an institution can provide a profile to hook in to our framework
          nice to support deployment that's manageable and secure for a central WebSSO
  [Steve] support Incommon/SAML 2.0
	  provide a Java plug-in for Shib
          ability to work with other OOB solutions (Moss, Confluence)

[SL] Shib service provider written in C, not that extensible
[SO] Can we use CAS as a framework to interoperate with Shib?
[SL] Even if we stay with CAS, we could make some architectural changes
[SO] Current implementation is less-coupled to Dorian and Authn Svc

[SO] Need a couple weeks of his time to develop design and implementation plan 
     -document new use cases
     -investigate potential solutions
     -develop LOE

Action Items
------------
1) John will reach out to Sichen to allocate Santhosh's time.
